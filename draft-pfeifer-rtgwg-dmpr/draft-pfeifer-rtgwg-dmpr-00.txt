   disappearing and reappearing nodes,

3.  Message Format

3.1.  Header

   A DMPR packet consists of a preamble, followed by zero or more
   Extension Headers followed by zero or one Payload.  Each Extension
   Header and Payload is defined by a Type.

         +---------+--------------------------------------------+
         |   Type  |                    Use                     |
         +---------+--------------------------------------------+
         |  0-119  |              Extension Header              |
         | 120-127 | Extension Header, reserved for private use |
         | 128-247 |                  Payload                   |
         | 248-255 |     Payload, reserved for private use      |
         +---------+--------------------------------------------+

                 Possible Types are further defined below

                          Table 1: Possible Types

3.1.1.  Preamble

   The preamble of a DMPR packet is as follows

   Magic
      A 3-bit Magic: 0b010

   Reserved
      Reserved for future use

   NextType
      The type of the next header or payload.

3.1.2.  Extension Header

   An Extension Header consists of the type immediately following this
   header, a length specifier, and the Extension Header data.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   NextType
      The type of the immediately following header or payload (as
      specified in the packet preamble description)

   Length
      8-bit unsigned integer: The length of the Data field in 2-octets

   Data
      The header-specific data.

3.1.3.  Payload

   The Payload consists of the data until the end of the packet.
   Payloads may be recursive, i.e. contain a valid packet (or parts of
   it) in themselves, payload processors therefore MUST have the ability
   to feed their result back into the message processing chain.

3.1.3.1.  Payload: Keep-Alive

   Type: 128

   This is a keep-alive packet, the payload length is zero.
   Implementations SHOULD reset the message hold timer for the sending
   node upon receiving a keep-alive packet

3.1.3.2.  Payload: Compressed JSON

   Type: 129

   LZMA-compressed standard-compliant JSON data (TODO RFC 7159) This is
   the main routing data, its structure is defined TODO: ref

3.1.3.3.  Payload: Fragmentation

   Type: 130

   A packet greater than the MTU between two nodes SHOULD be fragmented
   using the fragmentation payload.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     The Fragmentation Payload Header

   Identifier
      Identifies possibly concurrent fragmented packets.
      Implementations SHOULD use an incrementing counter to practically
      eliminate the possibility of a collision.

   L(ast)
      Last, set to 1 if this packet has the highest packet offset in
      this fragmentation collection, i.e. is the last packet.

   Packet index
      7-bit unsigned integer.  Defines the index of this packet in the
      list of fragments resulting in the fragmentation of the original
      packet.  The first packet has offset zero.

   When a packet is larger than the MTU of the link between two nodes it
   SHOULD be fragmented.  For this the sending node computes the maximum

Internet-Draft          Dynamic MultiPath Routing         September 2017


   effective payload size for packets sent (i.e MTU less preamble,
   possibly extension headers and the fragmentation header) and splits
   the original packet into parts with this size.  For each of this
   parts it sends a packet with the fragmentation header set to a common
   Identifier, an according packet offset and the LAST bit set for the
   last fragment.

   The receiving node keeps track of all received fragments, grouping
   them by source address and Identifier.  As soon as a all fragments of
   a packet have been received, the reconstructed packet MUST be fed
   back into the message processing chain as if it were a new, just
   received packet.  Fragments MUST be regularly purged based on a hold
   timer.

3.2.  Message Types

3.2.1.  General Fields

   All fields which are required in every message

3.2.2.  Full Update

   fields and description of a full update

3.2.3.  Partial Update

3.2.4.  Keep Alive

   keepalive

3.3.  Requests

4.  Data Structures

   Information Base

5.  Optional Features

5.1.  Asymmetric Link Detection

   How should asymmetric link detection work/how can it be implemented

5.2.  Full Only Mode

   when/how to switch the mode

6.  Introduction

   The original specification of xml2rfc format is in RFC 2629
   [RFC2629].

7.  Simple List

   List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
   'format'.

   o  First bullet

   o  Second bullet

   You can write text here as well.

8.  Subsections and Tables

8.1.  A Subsection

   By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
   be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

8.2.  Tables

   .. are very similar to figures:

Internet-Draft          Dynamic MultiPath Routing         September 2017


     Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
                  then has a "c" element for its content.

                          +----------+----------+
                          | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                          +----------+----------+
                          |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                          |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                          |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                          +----------+----------+

                      which is a very simple example.

                       Table 2: A Very Simple Table

9.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short   With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

       And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

      The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to fool
      many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

9.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

   First list:

Internet-Draft          Dynamic MultiPath Routing         September 2017


   R1  #1

   R2  #2

   R3  #3

   Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

   Second list:

   R4  #4

   R5  #5

   R6  #6

9.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

   List continues here.

   Third list:

   R7  #7

   R8  #8

   R9  #9

   R10 #10

   The end of the list.

   The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
   used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
   output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
   nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details).  It also has a
   "type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
   'type="abnf"'.  In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
   piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
   will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
   error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
   ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
   components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
   versions of xml2rfc.

   This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable
   [DOMINATION].

12.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs

   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.
